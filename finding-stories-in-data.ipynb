    "## Introduction\n",
    "The [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebook provides an intuitive, flexible and shareable way to work with code. It's a potentially invaluable tool for journalists who need to analyse data quickly and reproducibly, particularly as part of a graphics-oriented workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "This aim of this tutorial is to help you become familiar with the notebook and its role in a [Python](https://www.python.org/) data analysis toolkit. We'll start with a demographic dataset and explore and analyse it visually in the notebook to see what it can tell us about people who voted ‘leave’ in the UK's EU referendum. To finish, we'll output a production-quality graphic using [Bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/).\n",

    "Let's [import](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html) pandas into our project and assign it to the variable `pd`, because that's easier to type than `pandas`. While we're at it, let's import all the other modules we'll need for this tutorial and also let [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) know that we want it to plot charts here in the notebook rather than in a separate window. Enter the following code into the first cell in your notebook and hit shift-return to run the code block:"
